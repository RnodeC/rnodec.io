## What does RnodeC do?

All decentralized systems require decentralized communities to make the network unbreakable.  We are here to do our duty and fight the good fight.  

Originally, this meant that we operated nodes in blockchains that we believe in (bitcoin, ethereum, terra, solana).  Our journey began with Terra - we ran a [validator node](https://hubble.figment.io/terra/chains/columbus-4/validators/AFE642901FCA4501BC0E2641A43B54E8E9D948FC) for a few months before realizing that, essentially, we just didn't have the capital to continue running a secure, robust architecture.  At the same time, our passions were pulling us towards something higher level, for which we search.   


## So does RnodeC actually do anything?  

Actually we do still run an [eth2 validator node](https://beaconcha.in/validator/99abaf48501f91bffb12684c831596f0a8979e2c24d5ad021c9cf850cf29b45d88bc1ab5359462410654e6ecb36fe8dd).  This one is maintained pro bono on behalf of friends and family, for the community.  Our fee is the experience.
