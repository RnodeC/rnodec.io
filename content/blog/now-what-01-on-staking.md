## Ok I'm in, now what?

So you [understand and are excited by Terra](../what-is-terra.md), you've got your `LUNA` and/or your `UST` in hand and are ready for the magic to start. There are so many options it can be overwhelming.  We'll begin a series examining the pro's and cons (not too many cons) of all the options given to us here on the Terra network. It is important to note that not all APR's are created equal. APR's on each respective platform are paid out in in that respective platform's token. You earn `ANC` (or `UST`) on Anchor and `MIR` on Mirror, etc

## Terra Station

We will start with home base, Terra Station.  The starting gate.  From your Terra Station you can swap your `UST` for `LUNA` or vice versa (along with other assets like `ANC`, `MIR`, all `mAssets`, and other stables). You can then take these assets to other Terra platforms to earn more UST and/or that platform's native token. 

## On Staking

Or, for a simple, low risk, low maintenance approach - you can keep your `LUNA` in the Terra Station and simply delegate or "stake" (or ðŸ¥©) with one of the Terra Platform validators.  These validators are what make the Terra Platform tick.  Without validators, there is no network.  Validators add transactions to the blockchain and collectively maintain decentralization.  Validators have to pay for infrastructure and commit their own time operating a validator node in the network.  Staking is how you can help support these validators while also earning for yourself.  

Choosing which validator to stake with is an interesting question.  There are alot of worthy options and not much criteria to choose from.  You, the staker, really can't go wrong.  Our opinion, simply put, is that all validators deserve support, but it is particularly important to support those who need supporting, for the overall greater good of the network.  The more ðŸ¥© a validator has, the more power they carry in the network.  If the distribution of ðŸ¥© becomes too top heavy, the decentralization and robustness of the network becomes compromised.  

It is also quite reasonable to consider staking to the validators who are themselves actively contributing to the Terra community and growth of the ecosystem.  The more Terra grows, the more your `LUNA` grows.  Smart Stake, for example, built [this very useful and popular dashboard](https://terra.smartstake.io/).  #validatordreams

Delegating your `LUNA` with a Terra validator not only earns you an APR (currently ~12%) with the majority paid out in `LUNA` (along with other Terra stables), but it also allows you to be eligible for airdrops in existing protocols (Mirror and Anchor).  An "airdrop" is a "free token giveaway" in exchange for participating in  along with being the point of reference for network snapshots determining airdrops for future protocols as well! Nebula and Ozone are two on immediate horizon. 

One myth worth busting:  There is no correlation between validator returns and validator size.  The difference in return validator-to-validator is minimal.  Plus, historical returns arenâ€™t necessarily a predictor of future returns.  It is reasonable to effectively consider each validator as the same in that regard.  Pay attention to commission rates of course impacts returns. However, **be wary of 0% commission rates**.  It is unlikely there will stay 0% for long.  If that is important to you, at least make sure you are diligent about monitoring any rate changes.  

RnodeC has chosen to take a transparent approach to our commission structure:  5% fixed rate.  That rate can never change due to our 0% max daily change setting.  

Lastly, it is worth pointing out that staking does carry a small degree of risk.  If your validator's node should go offline for whatever reason, the validator + all their stakers are subjected to a "slashing" penalty.  It is not a huge penalty and your original investment is not in jeopardy, but it is still important to make sure your validator is going to keep the lights on.  

## Why Stake?

While the APR delegating on `LUNA` is not as attractive on the surface as current options on Anchor or Mirror, it has the hidden benefits of:  

1. Being paid out in the most valuable, appreciating, asset on Terra, "The Queen Bee": `LUNA`  
2. Receiving unaccounted for returns on current and existing projects on the Terra network in the form of airdrops.  
3. Supporting and sustaining the engines of the Terra network.  

The strongest networks are the most decentralized networks and in our opinion it is important to spread your ðŸ¥©. The rewards will vary marginally from validator to validator but the benefits of a vast, robust network will pay far greater dividends down the line.

(possibly add this in kinda hard to approach with throwing other guys under the bus and begging?)

## What's next for RnodeC?

Terra has just crossed the 100 validator mark! That is a great thing.  As we have mentioned, the more functioning, operating validators the better it is for Terra.  Terra has a great community of validators who have been very helpful along the way as we are all learning from each other.  We have our scripts on our github as do many others.  Currently, only the top 100 validators in terms of delegated ðŸ¥© are considered "active" validators thereby earning rewards.  We believe it is important to have "little guys" like ourselves and Pete's Fan Club, major community players like Terra Bites, Orbital Command, and Stake.Systems, along with corporate partners like Orion.Money and SCB 10x all working together to help make Terra the strongest and most decentralized community. 

So we will be working hard to continue to contribute to the community however we can and earn our spot in the top 100.
