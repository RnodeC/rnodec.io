## Ok I'm staked, now what?

So you have [delegated] (https://rnodec.io/blog/now-what-01-on-staking/) some of your `LUNA` amongst a few worthy validators to earn some more LUNA, become eligible for current and future Terra platform airdrops, and support the engines of the Terra network. Now that you got some ðŸ¥© in the oven, you want to start saving on the Anchor protocol! Funny thing about saving on Anchor is it can look a lot like earning...

## Anchor

[Anchor] (https://anchorprotocol.com/) is a savings platform within the Terra network where you can earn real savings through a variety of ways. It can be a bit extensive so we will break it up into two parts because you can use both your `LUNA` and `UST` on Anchor and do a a few differnt things which we'll try to breakdown as simply as possible here. Any questions about more intricate "how to's" we'd be happy to answer in our [telegram] (https://t.me/rnodec_terra) or [twitter] (https://twitter.com/RnodeC) or you can also find us in the Terra network discord and telegram communities. For these posts here we are going to be using broad strokes to hopefully familiarize yourself with the possibilities.

_In order to use any of the extended protocols in the Terra Network you will first need download a browser extension for your Terra Station wallet to connect to said protocols. This is straightforwad process but don't hesitate to reach out if you are having difficulty._

## On Saving (part 1)

So let's start with what you can do with your `LUNA` on Anchor. First, you would head to the "Bond" tab to 'mint' some `Bonded LUNA`, or `bLUNA`. The value of`bLUNA` is engineered to be equal to value of `LUNA`. However you can deposit `bLUNA` as collateral to take out a loan. This is done by delegating your `LUNA` to one of the whitelisted validators in the Terra network through the Anchor protocol, still on the "Bond" page. The trade-off of minting `bLUNA` is you do not receive the rewards you would for delegating the `LUNA` yourself. The advantage is that you are now able to use `bLUNA` as collateral for a loan. Best part is youget paid to do so! The current APR is 40% in the form of the Anchor protocol's native token, `ANC`. 

After you have minted your `bLUNA` you will then head to the "Borrow" page where you will 'provide' your `bLUNA` as collateral for a loan. After providing the `bLUNA`, you will then choose the 'borrow' option to receive Anchored UST, or `aUST`. On the "Earn" page you will then withdraw your `aUST` for regular `UST` and there you can use it among the Terra ecosystem as you wish! During the duration of your loan you will earn `ANC` on the borrowed amount which you can check on the "Govern" tab. Thus you get paid to borrow!

_You get to choose how much `aUST` you can borrow. Keep in mind that you must keep a minimum of 200% of the borrowed amount in collateral, the recommended amount is 300%. You risk losing your precious `LUNA` due to liquidation should `LUNA` price take a dip and your `bLUNA` value goes below 200% of your borrowed `aUST` value! You can maintain your collateral during the course of the loan by either providing more `bLUNA` or repaying as much of the loan as necessary_

Whenever you want to reclaim your `bLUNA` you simply return to the "Borrow" tab on Anchor, 'repay' the loan and 'withdraw' the collateralized `bLUNA`. After that you head back to the "Bond" tab then 'burn' your withdrawn `bLUNA`. After you have burned the `bLUNA` back to `LUNA`, you then go to 'claim' your `LUNA` and initiate the 21 day unlock period to receive your `LUNA`!

Come back for "On Saving (b)" to see what you can do with your UST on Anchor!
