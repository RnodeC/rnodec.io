## Ok I'm staked, now what?!

So you've [delegated some of your `LUNA`]({{< relref "now-what-01-on-staking.md" >}}) amongst a few worthy validators and in doing so you are earning some more `LUNA`.  Which means you have also made yourself eligible for current and future Terra platform airdrops, and are supporting the engines of the Terra network.  A great start.  ðŸ¥© on the grill, or in the oven, or on the pan.  But you got some undelegated `LUNA` and you want to start saving!  Very sharp.  The modern financial world has taught us that saving is hoarding.  But that is not what saving is at all.  Saving should reward you.  And that's the cool thing about saving on Anchor - it feels a lot like earning.  

## A Level Set

The various "protocols" on Terra, such as Anchor, can be confusing. There's also a lot more [coming] (https://twitter.com/SmartStake/status/1387811667548020739?s=20)!  What is "Anchor" vs "Terra"?  Think about "Terra" as the foundation, and all other protocols such as "Anchor" are just an extension, built on top of, and playing by the rules of, **Terra**.  The naming convention is quite clever.  Terra = Earth.  Everything in Earth's domain is it's own economy.  Andd the Moon is up there watching over us, it's gravity holding it all together.  Everything else is... tertiary.  

## Anchor  

[Anchor](https://anchorprotocol.com/) is a savings platform built on top of the Terra network which enables you to earn real savings in a variety of ways.  It can be a bit extensive, so we will break it up into two parts.  You can use both your `LUNA` and `UST` on Anchor and do a few differnt things.  We'll break these down as simply as possible here.  Any questions about the intricacies of the procedure we'd be happy to answer in our [telegram](https://t.me/rnodec_terra) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/RnodeC) or you can also find us in the Terra network discord and or telegram communities.  For these posts here though we are going to be using broad strokes to hopefully familiarize you with the possibilities.  

## On Saving (with `LUNA`, or should I say `bLUNA`)

So let's start with what you can do with your `LUNA` on Anchor.  First, you would head to the _"Bond"_ tab to "mint" some `Bonded LUNA` or `bLUNA` (minting `bLUNA` means triggering the Anchor protocol to create `bLUNA`).  `bLUNA` is simply `LUNA` that has been specially marked as collateral that you can use to take out loans.  The value of `bLUNA` is engineered to be equal to the value of `LUNA`.  Your `LUNA` belongs to Anchor now, and your `bLUNA` belongs to you.  **And you are in Anchor.**      

What is actually happening here, is you are delegating your `LUNA` to the network via a group of whitelisted validators (the Anchor protocol is doing this). These validators are pooled together for this process so it is not important which one you choose. If one of these validators has rewards slashed it is distributed throughout the `bLUNA` pool which we will explain is not relevant anyway. The tradeoff for minting `bLUNA` instead of keeping it as `LUNA`, however, is you do not receive the rewards of delegating the `LUNA` yourself (**_Anchor_** is).  The reward is that not only do you get extra capital to use in the Terra ecosystem, you get paid to do so!  The current APR is paid out 40% per year in the form of the Anchor protocol's native token: `ANC`. 

**_In order to use any of the extended protocols in the Terra Network you will first need to download a browser extension for your Terra Station wallet to connect to said protocols. This is a straightforwad process but don't hesitate to reach out if you are having difficulty._**  


After you have minted your `bLUNA` you will then head to the _"Bond"_ tab where you will  choose the *provide* option to initiate your `bLUNA` as collateral for a loan.  After providing the `bLUNA`, you will then choose the *borrow* option to receive `Anchored UST`, or `aUST`.  On the _"Earn"_ page you will see your `aUST`. You can then choose the *withdraw* option to exchange your `aUST` for `UST`, and from there you can use your newly borrowed `UST` throughout the Terra ecosystem as you wish!  During the duration of your loan you will earn `ANC` on the borrowed amount which you can check and claim periodically on the _"Govern"_ tab.  Thus you get paid to borrow!

**_You get to choose how much `aUST` you can borrow. Keep in mind that you must keep a minimum of 200% of the borrowed amount in collateral, the recommended amount is 300%. You risk losing your precious `LUNA` due to liquidation should `LUNA` price take a dip and your `bLUNA` value goes below 200% of your borrowed `aUST` value! You can maintain your collateral during the course of the loan by either providing more `bLUNA` or repaying as much of the loan as necessary_**  

Whenever you want to reclaim your `bLUNA` you simply return to the _"Borrow"_ tab on Anchor, select the *repay* option to and pay back your outstanding balance. Then select the *withdraw* option on the now unprovided `bLUNA`.  After that, you head back to the _"Bond"_ tab then select the *burn* option to conver your withdrawn `bLUNA` back to `LUNA`.  After you have done this, you will then choose the *claim* option and initiate the 21 day unlock period to receive your `LUNA`!
