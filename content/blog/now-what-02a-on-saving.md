## Ok I'm staked, now what?!

So you've [delegated some of your `LUNA`]({{< relref "now-what-01-on-staking.md" >}}) amongst a few worthy validators and are thus earning some more `LUNA`.  Which means you have also made yourself eligible for current and future Terra platform airdrops, and are supporting the engines of the Terra network.  A great start.  ðŸ¥© in the oven.  But you got some `LUNA` left over and you want to start saving on the cool new Anchor protocol!  Very sharp.  The modern financial world has taught us that saving is hoarding.  But that is not what saving is at all.  Saving should reward you.  And that's the cool thing about saving on Anchor - it feels a lot like earning.  

## A Level Set

The various "protocols" on Terra, such as Anchor, can be confusing (there are lots more coming!).  What is "Anchor" vs "Terra"?  Think about "Terra" as the foundation, and all other protocols such as "Anchor" just an extension, built on top of, and playing by the rules of, **Terra**.  The naming convention is quite clever.  Terra = earth.  Each country it's own section of land, it's own economy.  The Moon is up there watching over us, it's gravity holding it all together.  Everything else is... tertiary.  

## Anchor  

[Anchor](https://anchorprotocol.com/) is a savings platform built on top of the Terra network which enables you to earn real savings in a variety of ways.  It can be a bit extensive, so we will break it up into two parts.  You can use both your `LUNA` and `UST` on Anchor and do a few differnt things.  We'll break these down as simply as possible here.  Any questions about more intricate "how to's" we'd be happy to answer in our [telegram](https://t.me/rnodec_terra) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/RnodeC) or you can also find us in the Terra network discord and or telegram communities.  For these posts here we are going to be using broad strokes to hopefully familiarize you with the possibilities.  

## On Saving (with `LUNA`, or should I say `bLUNA`)

So let's start with what you can do with your `LUNA` on Anchor.  First, you would head to the **Bond** tab to "mint" some Bonded `LUNA` or `bLUNA` ("minting" `bLUNA` means triggering the Anchor protocol to create `bLUNA`).  `bLUNA` is simply `LUNA` that has been specially marked as collateral to take loans out against.  The value of `bLUNA` is engineered to be equal to the value of `LUNA`.  Your `LUNA` belongs to Anchor now, and your `bLUNA` belongs to you.  **And you are in Anchor.**      

What is actually happening here, is your `LUNA` is being delegated to the network - the validators (the Anchor protocol is doing this).  The tradeoff, however, is you do not receive the rewards of delegating the `LUNA` yourself (*Anchor* is).  The reward is that not only do you get extra capital to use in the Terra ecosystem, you get paid to do so!  The current APR is paid out 40% per year in the form of the Anchor protocol's native token: `ANC`. 

**_In order to use any of the extended protocols in the Terra Network you will first need to download a browser extension for your Terra Station wallet to connect to said protocols. This is a straightforwad process but don't hesitate to reach out if you are having difficulty._**  


After you have minted your `bLUNA` you will then head to the **Borrow** page where you will *provide* your `bLUNA` as collateral for a loan (you are officially taking out a loan).  After providing the `bLUNA`, you will then choose the *borrow* option to receive Anchored UST, or `aUST`.  On the **Earn** page you will then *withdraw* your `aUST` for `UST`, and there you can use it throughout the Terra ecosystem as you wish!  During the duration of your loan you will earn `ANC` on the borrowed amount which you can check on the **Govern** tab.  Thus you get paid to borrow!

**_You get to choose how much `aUST` you can borrow. Keep in mind that you must keep a minimum of 200% of the borrowed amount in collateral, the recommended amount is 300%. You risk losing your precious `LUNA` due to liquidation should `LUNA` price take a dip and your `bLUNA` value goes below 200% of your borrowed `aUST` value! You can maintain your collateral during the course of the loan by either providing more `bLUNA` or repaying as much of the loan as necessary_**  

Whenever you want to reclaim your `bLUNA` you simply return to the **Borrow** tab on Anchor, *repay* the loan and *withdraw* the collateralized `bLUNA`.  After that, you head back to the **Bond** tab then *burn* your withdrawn `bLUNA`.  After you have burned the `bLUNA` back to `LUNA`, you then *claim* your `LUNA` and initiate the 21 day unlock period to receive your `LUNA`!
