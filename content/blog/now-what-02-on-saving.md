On saving (part 1)

So you've delegated some of your LUNA amongst a few validators to earn some more LUNA, become eligible for current and future Terra platform airdrops, and support the engines of the Terra network. Now you want to start saving on the Anchor protocol! Funny thing about saving on Anchor is it can look a lot like earning..

You can can take both your LUNA and UST over to Anchor and do a variety of things there which we'll try to breakdown as simply as possible. Any questions about more intricate "how to's" we'd be happy to answer in our telegram or twitter, and you can also find us on discord, but here we are just using broad strokes.

So let's start with what you can do with your LUNA on Anchor. First you would head to the "Bond" tab to mint some Bonded LUNA, or bLUNA. bLUNA is LUNA you will deposit as collateral to take loans out against. This is done by delegating your LUNA, however the trade off is you do not receive the rewards of delegating the LUNA yourself. The reward is that you are able to borrow against this LUNA, and get paid to do so! (currently ~40% APR). 

After you have minted your bLUNA you will then head to the "Borrow" page where you will provide your collateral for a loan. After providing the bLUNA, you will then receive Anchored UST, or aUST on your "Earn" page. 
Keep in mind that you must keep a minimum of 200% of the borrowed amount in collateral, the recommended is 300%. You risk losing your precious LUNA due to liquidation should LUNA go into a dip and your bLUNA value goes below 200% of your borrowed aUST value!

On the "Earn" page you will then withdraw your aUST for regular UST and there you can use it among the Terra ecosystem as you wish!  Whenever you to reclaim your bLUNA you simply repay the loan, withdraw the collateralized bLUNA from the "Borrow" page, and then burn said bLUNA on the "Bond" page. After you have burned the bLUNA back to LUNA, you then go to the claim page to initiate the 21 day unlock to receive your LUNA back.
