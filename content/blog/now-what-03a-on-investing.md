# Takes money to make money

So you've got some of your `LUNA` [delegated] (https://rnodec.io/blog/now-what-01-on-staking/) on Terra Station, some of your `LUNA` [bonded] (https://rnodec.io/blog/now-what-02a-on-saving/) in Anchor, and you've started [saving] (https://rnodec.io/blog/now-what-02b-on-saving/) with some of your `UST` in Anchor. We also began to explore some of the more risk tolerant options in Anchor in Liquidity Pooling. However,  that is just one of the many options you canchoose to undertake in Mirror. The Terra ecosystem's investing protocol. In this part of the series we will look into more of the options presented.

## Let's start with the Basics (Trading)

Mirror is a place where you can invest your `UST` into popular assets that have been "mirrored" for compatibility in the Mirror protocol, giving them the denomination of `mAssets`.  These are the tradable equities you are most familiar with; popular stocks including all of FAANG, commodities such as USO and IAU, and your favorite cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. There are over 20 `mAssets` currently and new proposals are always in the works. COIN was approved (becoming `mCOIN`) within the past month and DOGE is in polling currently. These are assets you can buy and sell on the Terra platform. While the Mirror (Terraswap) price is dictated by free market within the Mirror protocol, there is an Oracle price as well which we will discuss later when talking about minting.

So you can buy and sell these `mAssets` just as you would on a traditional brokerage site however you are able to do so 24 hours a day at minimal fees within the Terra ecosystem.  The way to do this is relatively straight forward and we will guide you through the basics here. Go to [Mirror] (Terra.Mirror.Finance) and connect your wallet, the same as you did on Anchor. Then go to the _**Trade**_ tab and click the bottom scroll down icon to find whichever `mAsset` you wish to purchase. Enter the amount of `UST` you would like to use to purchase in the top section and select the _"Buy"_ option. You are now the proud owner of a Mirrored Asset! You will now see this balance on the top section of the _**My Page**_ tab. Whenever you wish to convert back to `UST` you will return to the _**Trade**_ tab and go to the _"Sell"_ sub-section. There you will do the reverse of the _"Buy"_ sub-section and select which ever `mAsset` you would like to sell on the drop down of the top section and then input the amount of that `mAsset` you would like to convert to `UST`.

## Your Mirror Dashboard

Now you will have some new data on the _**My Page**_ tab. This is your Mirror dashboard. You will be able to keep track of all your `mAsset` holdings along with other things we will touch on later in this series.  You will also be able to track all your Mirror transactions as well which you should now see after trading your first `mAssets`.

#### Disclaimer

#### We are by no means financial advisors, and will try to keep this as informative as possible without delving too much into investment strategies and recommended courses of action. We simply want to show you what you can do in the Terra network.  This is getting into the pretty complex investing portions of Terra and if you would like to know more next level things about how best to deploy your UST we would be happy to give you recommendations. There are also more in depth workings on how to use these protocols out there too. One of the first ones that we learned from was [nachodon's fantastic youtube series] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTmU93NVu6tUsa0j0SzQRrQ).
