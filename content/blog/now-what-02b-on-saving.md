## On Saving (part b)

So you got some ðŸ¥© cooking with a few worthy Terra Station validators. You got some of your extra `LUNA` in Anchor bonded, provided as collateral, and you have borrowed `UST` against it.  Now you got some `UST` burning a hole in your proverbial pocket.  What can you do with it?

Anchor is, at it's core, a savings platform.  Although we are earning a yield on our `bLUNA` (in the form of `ANC`), the real way to use Anchor to it's full potential is with `UST`.  Doesn't have to be the `UST` we just borrowed, but it certainly makes sense for it to be.  So we'll deposit our unused `UST` and earn an APY on it (currently 20%).  While that APY has fluctuated higher, Anchor is programmed to always be at least 20%.  This is where the `UST` you borrowed from your `bLUNA` comes from!  By doing this, your `UST` deposit is automatically compounded (APY) by 20% and you can save and grow your unused `UST`. 

This is simply done by going to the **Earn** tab and selecting the *deposit* option and selecting how much `UST` you would like to earn on.  That's it, your anchor is dropped, you are saving.  

> Keep in mind that you never want to use all of your `UST` on any transaction. Partly because there's so many things you can do with it throughout Terra's platforms, but mainly because you are always going to need some `UST` to pay for transactions. Paying for each transaction is what makes the Terra network churn.

Another thing you can do with your `UST` on Anchor is directly buy the native coin `ANC`. Remember this is also the coin you get paid out in for providing your `bLUNA` and borrowing against.  If you would like to own more of this token you could do so by going to the **Govern** tab and selecting the *Trade Anc* option, and purchasing as much as you'd like to convert your `UST` to.  

## What should I do with this `ANC`?

There are a couple things you can do with your `ANC` on the Anchor platform. The first is fairly straightforward and is directly stake it.  This currently earns about 7% APY paid in `ANC` and is a very safe option. It can be unstaked at any time with no unlocking period. 

To do this you would go to the middle of the **Govern** tab and select the *Actions* icon on the "ANC Governance" line and select how many `ANC` you would like to stake.  Once staked you are also eligible to vote on governance proposals in Anchor at the *Polls* at the bottom of the **Govern** tab.  A recent proposal that passed was the "Harpoon Protocol" (yet another unique Terra platform).  

## Mirror Teaser

The final option on the Anchor protocol is a good segue into our ensuing post(s) about what you can do on the ***Mirror platform***.  You have the option, on Mirror, to provide liquidity for the people trying to trade `UST` and `ANC` on Anchor's platform in the form of the `ANC`-`UST` "Liquidity Pool."  More to come on "LP's" in the next post, but keep in mind that we're gambling a bit here.  You are a bit more exposed to risk during volatility.  But in turn, can also earn higher rewards (currently about 90% APR!).  This `ANC` is not compounded automatically and has to be claimed along with your "`UST` Borrow" rewards. 

Here you are giving Anchor equal parts (in `UST` value) of `ANC` and `UST`. This is done by selecting the "`ANC`-`UST` LP" option on the **Govern** tab.  On the next page you will choose how much `ANC` you wish to "provide", of which there is required to be an equal amount of `UST` to go with it, so the pool remains balanced.  After you have selected this option you will then finalize by clicking *Add Liquidity*.  Doing this will give you `ANC`-`UST` LP tokens.  Once that has been completed you will return to the **Govern** tab and select the "..." icon on the "`ANC`-`UST` LP" line and select the *stake* option.  This too can be unstaked at any time, however upon unstaking, you must "withdraw" your liquidity in order to turn your "`ANC`-`UST` LP" into `ANC` and separate `UST`.

We would recommend holding off on this process until our next part on Mirror describing liquidity pooling more. You are liable to have your `ANC` token amount decrease due to Impermanent Loss which is a complex topic on the surface but a generally logical concept.

Well now we know how to "Save" (we use that term liberally here) on Terra. After we have secured our funds now we are ready to head to Mirror and start investing.
