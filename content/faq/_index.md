## What does RnodeC do?

We fight the good fight by operating nodes in blockchains that we believe in.  All decentralized systems require decentralized communities to make the network unbreakable.  We are here to do our duty.

## Why does RnodeC do it?

We believe in the dream.  What is the dream?  Well, it is subjective.  To us, the dream is freedom.  What is freedom?  Well, that too is subjective.  To us, freedom is friends, family and building.     

## Which Blockchains does RnodeC support?

Currently we run a validator in the [terraform.money](https://terraform.money) ecosystem.  For proof, [check out our validator node!](https://hubble.figment.io/terra/chains/columbus-4/validators/AFE642901FCA4501BC0E2641A43B54E8E9D948FC)

More to come!  

## How can I support RnodeC?

By staking your tokens (`$LUNA`, for example) to the RnodeC validator.  

Staking your tokens ($LUNA, for example) to our validator means more rewards for us.  Validator nodes share the pool of transaction fees in exchange for their support of the network.  

Staking your tokens to RnodeC is indeed supporting us, but really it is supporting yourself (earning a yield on your investment) and it is supporting the projects that we are involved in (such as Terra).  

## What is Staking?

"Staking" cryptocurrency is the alternative to just idle-y sitting on them and waiting for the number to go up.  It is a low-risk path to earn passive interest on your investment.  (there are high risk paths too!  Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss.)

Frankly, it makes no difference to you which node you stake your tokens to.  Considerations involved in that decision are first and foremost "do you trust the validator to stay online and behave well."  Decentralized networks have mechanisms in place to penalize validators who misbehave whether intentionally or unintentionally.  And these mechanisms impact all stakers as well, not just the validator.  So, choose a validator you can trust.
