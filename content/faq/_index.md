## What does RnodeC do?

We fight the good fight by operating nodes in blockchains that we believe in.  All decentralized systems require decentralized communities to make the network unbreakable.  We are here to do our duty.

## Which Blockchains does RnodeC support?

Currently we run a validator in the [terraform.money](https://terraform.money) ecosystem.  For proof, [check out our node](https://hubble.figment.io/terra/chains/columbus-4/validators/AFE642901FCA4501BC0E2641A43B54E8E9D948FC)

More to come!  

## How can I support RnodeC?

Supporting RnodeC is supporting yourself and supporting the projects that we are involved in.  But to answer your question, staking your tokens ($LUNA, for exmaple) to our validator means more rewards for us.  "Staking" coins is the alternative to just idle-y sitting on coins.  It is a low-risk path to earn passive on interest on your investment.
