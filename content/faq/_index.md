## What does RnodeC do?

We fight the good fight by operating nodes in blockchains that we believe in.  All decentralized systems require decentralized communities to make the network unbreakable.  We are here to do our duty.


## Which Blockchains does RnodeC support?

Currently we run a validator in the [terraform.money](https://terraform.money) ecosystem.  For proof, [check out our validator node!](https://hubble.figment.io/terra/chains/columbus-4/validators/AFE642901FCA4501BC0E2641A43B54E8E9D948FC)

More to come!  Maybe!  

## How can RnodeC help me?

By inspiring you to join us in the journey of the new world.  We'll see where this goes.

But if you get involved in Terra, you can start out by throwing us some ðŸ¥© 

Yes, staking your tokens to RnodeC is supporting us, but really it is supporting yourself (earning a yield on your investment) 


## What is Staking?

"Staking" cryptocurrency is one style of the alternative to just idle-y sitting on them and waiting for the number to go up.  It is a low-risk path to earn passive interest on your investment.  (there are high risk paths too!  Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss.)

Frankly, it makes no difference to *you* which node you stake your tokens to.  Decentralized networks have mechanisms in place to incentivize validators to behave well, so most do. But keep in mind, a strong network is a well-balanced network.
