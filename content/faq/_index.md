## What does RnodeC do?

We fight the good fight by operating nodes in blockchains that we believe in.  All decentralized systems require decentralized communities to make the network unbreakable.  We are here to do our duty.

## Why does RnodeC do it?

We believe in the dream.  What is the dream?  Well, it is subjective.  To us, the dream is freedom.  What is freedom?  Well, that too is subjective.  To us, freedom is friends, family and building.     

## Which Blockchains does RnodeC support?

Currently we run a validator in the [terraform.money](https://terraform.money) ecosystem.  For proof, [check out our validator node!](https://hubble.figment.io/terra/chains/columbus-4/validators/AFE642901FCA4501BC0E2641A43B54E8E9D948FC)

More to come!  

## How can I support RnodeC?

Supporting RnodeC is supporting yourself, and it is supporting the projects that we are involved in.  But to answer your question, staking your tokens ($LUNA, for example) to our validator means more rewards for us (validator nodes share the pool of transaction fees in exchange for their support of the network).  The staking choice for you is more or less irrelevant.  You want to stake with a validator that you can trust to consistently keep their node online and operational is about all.  And from that perspective, we got you!

## What is Staking?

"Staking" cryptocurrency is the alternative to just idle-y sitting on them, waiting for the number to go up.  It is a low-risk path to earn passive interest on your investment.
